# Responsive Portfolio

This is a responsive portfolio made with HTML CSS and bootstrap.

## Homework Assignment

this portfolio is a project where we took existing photos of a pre-made website and were asked to recreate the layout but with our own pictures and information.

I used media queries and bootstrap's responsive classes to manipulate the element of the page as the resolution changes.
